2.1.0 2014-03-31

* Featurette.get is now implemented in a way that allows garbage collection
  on removed DOM elements. Featurettes are now attached directly to the DOM
  rather than being stored in a collection in the `Featurette` class.
* Fixed an issue where calling `Featurette.load` within a featurette constructor
  would cause infinite recursion.
* Super special thanks to [Rick Harris](https://github.com/rickharris) for his
  help on this release.

2.0.3 2014-02-05

* Fixed an issue where featurettes that don't exist would cause featurette to
  stop loading.

* Removes unneeded parameter for `Featurette.load`
